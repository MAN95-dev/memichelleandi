                    <p>The Two Dolphins guesthouse is a charming accommodation option located in the picturesque town 
                        of Witsand, South Africa. This guesthouse is situated right on the banks of the beautiful Breede 
                        River, offering guests breathtaking views of the water and surrounding scenery.</p><br>

                    <p>I sat with key stakeholders to gather project requirements and understand their business. Then 
                        conducted market research to analyse competitors' offerings and identify potential opportunities. 
                        Based on these findings, built designs that met the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. 
                        This ensured that the project was aligned with business objectives and provided a user-friendly 
                        interface.</p>

                    <h2 class="header-2">The Problem</h2>
                    <p>One common problem when creating a guest house website is the challenge of effectively showcasing 
                        the unique features and amenities of the property, while also providing clear and easy-to-find 
                        information for potential guests. This can include issues such as limited visual assests, complex
                        booking systems, mobile optimisation and standing out from the competition. 
                    </p>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h2 class="header-2">The Goal</h2>
                    <p>To develop a website that is user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and straightforward design 
                        that allows visitors to easily navigate and find the information they need. The aim is to create a 
                        simple yet effective platform that showcases all the features and amenities of the accommodation 
                        in a visually appealing manner, without overwhelming the user with unnecessary details. The
                        priority is to ensure that the website provides a seamless and enjoyable user experience, allowing 
                        potential guests to make an informed decision about their stay.</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <h2 class="header-2">Why?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-5">Firstly, a website can help you reach a wider audience and attract more guests to your
                         guest house. Many travelers use the internet to research and book accommodations, so having an online 
                         presence can increase your visibility and make it easier for potential guests to find you.<br><br>

                        Secondly, a website can provide a convenient platform for guests to make reservations and inquiries. 
                        By including a booking form and contact information on your website, you can streamline the booking 
                        process and make it easier for guests to get in touch with you.<br><br>
                        
                        Thirdly, a website can help you showcase the unique features and amenities of your guest house. By 
                        including high-quality photos, descriptions, and reviews of your property, you can give potential 
                        guests a better idea of what to expect and why they should choose your guest house over others in 
                        the area.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, a website can also help you establish your brand and build trust with potential guests. 
                        By including information about your history, values, and customer service policies, you can create 
                        a more personal connection with visitors and make them more likely to choose your guest house for 
                        their next vacation or getaway.</p>
